## Overview

This paper proposes a method called **GDDSG (Graph-Driven Dynamic Similarity Grouping)** to address the issues of **class order sensitivity** and **intra-task class conflicts** in **Class Incremental Learning (CIL)**. The core idea is to reduce the impact of class order on model performance and to mitigate confusion caused by similar classes within the same task. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that reducing inter-class similarity can enhance model robustness by increasing the differences between optimal parameters across tasks. The GDDSG method employs a graph-based approach, where a similarity graph is constructed using the Welsh-Powell algorithm to group dissimilar classes together. Independent classifiers are then trained for each group, and the results are combined for predictions. Additionally, an incremental updating mechanism ensures that class groups are dynamically adjusted as new tasks arrive, optimizing the feature space and improving the modelâ€™s ability to handle class conflicts and forgetfulness.
